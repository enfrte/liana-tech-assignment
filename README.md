# Programming assignment 

## Feedback

The task was quite easy, however it took me about 10 hours to complete because I hadn't done any front end layout in about 6 months. I ended up not using a CSS style framework, as I find they get in the way more, unless the layout has been designed with that framework in mind. 

It was interesting to use php without a framework. It made me realise how bad I am at OOP in this case, as I didn't know which pattern would be suitable for something like this. I ended up using procedural code in this case, as the requirements were quite simple.  

## Problems 

Upon opening the link to the designs, I realised I didn't have Photoshop. I managed to open the .psd file another app, which kind of worked and got me some of what I needed. It took a little extra time to hunt down icons and such online, as they were not available from the .psd file. Luckily there was a preview attached to the dropbox download, so I used that for visual reference.  

## QA

Tested in Chrome and Firefox, and in Chrome's mobile browser previewer.
